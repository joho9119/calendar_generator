# calendar-generator

## Overview

`calendar-generator` is a zero-dependency Python module that generates complete calendar-dimension data including year, month, day, quarter, weekday, and more. It is designed to be extremely fast by primarily using integer math. The only date object instantiated is the initial date for a simple weekday check, making it highly efficient for generating large date ranges.

## Background
I wrote this initially to teach myself how to back into dates/date properties via integer math. It turned out to be reasonably performant (20-30% faster than stdlib datetime/calendar-based functions, but slower than vectorized date ranges generated by NumPy/C-based libraries), so I figured I would share in case others would find it useful! This was designed to be as simple as possible, so it is also a useful reference to understand how some of these date functions work as integer math.

## Use Cases

- Any application requiring fast, detailed calendar data generation.
- Integrating with Django or other web frameworks for calendar-based features.
- Populating date dimension tables in data warehouses.
- Data analytics and business intelligence reporting pipelines.

## Installation

You can install `calendar-generator` via pip:

```bash
pip install calendar-generator
```

## API Reference / Usage

### `generate_calendar_dates(start_date: str, end_date: str) -> list[CalendarDateDict]`

Generates a list of calendar date dictionaries from `start_date` to `end_date` (inclusive). Dates should be provided as integers (e.g. `2020`). The full year(s) will be generated. Here is a simple example of how to import and use the generator:

```python
from calendar_generator import generate_calendar_dates_dicts

# Generate calendar dates from 2020-01-01 to 2025-12-31.
calendar_dates = generate_calendar_dates_dicts(2020, 2025)

for date_info in calendar_dates:
    print(date_info)
```

## Example Output

Each entry in the generated list is a `CalendarDateDict` with the following fields:

```python
class CalendarDateDict(TypedDict):
    year: int
    quarter: int
    month: int
    day: int
    day_of_year: int
    week: int
    weekday: int
    days_in_year: int
    is_leap_year: bool
    is_weekend: bool
    is_month_end: bool
    is_quarter_end: bool
    is_year_end: bool
```

## Features

- Generates comprehensive calendar dimension data: year, month, day, quarter, ISO week, weekday, etc.
- Uses integer arithmetic to maximize performance.
- No external dependencies - written in pure Python.
- Returns data as a list of `CalendarDateDict` objects for easy integration with data pipelines or web applications.
- Suitable for large date ranges and high-performance applications.
